<p><img src="/images/eddie_grey_bio_image002.jpg" alt="Eddie Grey Bio" width="165" height="216" hspace="12" align="left" />Los Angeles based Trio Eddie Grey have worked consistently to create fresh and unique music that attracts the widest audience possible. Comprised of frontman Eddie Grey (singer / songwriter / guitarist / percussionist), Patrick Coggins (drummer / percussionist / songwriter) and newest addition Tony White (Saxophone), the bands intricate sound is fueled by an ingenious group of musicians with diverse backgrounds and experiences that all strive to make artistically sound music. The members have separately played along side the Plan White T's, and Poncho Sanchez. It took many formations for the band to find this foundation, from duo to quartet, to what is now a rock-solid trio that came to be from friendships to chance meetings in record stores.
</p>
                  
<p>With influences ranging from the songwriter sound of John Mayer and Jason Mraz,  to Crosby, Stills and Nash and Sting, it's no wonder that Eddie Grey's sounds defies any distinct classification. In 2010, Eddie Grey released an all-acoustic LP "One Life" and the subsequent first single "South Carolina" garnered them a following in Los Angeles market. This album was quickly followed by their first studio album "The Love Thief," which cemented the fact that Eddie Grey was a force to be reckoned with, easily becoming a thief to all genres.  The trio's lead track "Hideaway" is an unabashed pop-punk anthem of  raw guitar riffs and love-stricken lyrics.  The track "My Only Thoughts of You"  is beautifully played and well-written. Lined with a soft guitar solo, the track is romantic and visceral.  "Mary Go Round" delivers a funky blend of reggae and soft rock, with sweet harmonic vocals that sound similar to Bruno Mars- it's a real genre-defying track.</p>
                  
<p>Grey's vibrant sound explodes with energy and excitement in the bands live shows.  They have performed in venues like The Hotel Cafe, The Key Club ,  the Viper Room, The House Of Blues, and have built themselves a consistent audience in Los Angeles. Most recently, Eddie Grey has taken their show to middle schools in an effort to promote artistic expression and music education in California schools, playing and speaking in front of huge audiences. Their live shows are as much an expression of their talents as they are a way to advocate for the things they are most passionate about, from their work with the American Red Cross Japan Relief back in 2011 to their performances in the LA Unified School Districts.</p>

<p>Still high off the success of "The Love Thief," Eddie Grey has been performing locally on a consistent basis, and are planning many more shows in Southern California over the months to come. With high hopes to play larger venues and music festivals in the future, they are taking all the steps needed to expand their fan-base and spread their music to a larger audience.  Eddie Grey has something for everyone and promises to make waves among the mainstream community, while keeping its desirable indie roots intact.</p>
